# Palindrome-Check
- write a funtion that take a non-empty string representing whether the string is a palindrome
- A palindrome is defined as a String  taht written the same forward and backward.
# Solution:
- check the first and last letter if there is any not equal we will return false 
- if there is not thing happen for false return true.
- time complexity : O(N/2) 
- space complexity: O(1);
